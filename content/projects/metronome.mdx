Recently, a new design system called Baklava Design was announced by the software team of the Turkish e-commerce marketplace Trendyol. I made this project to try Baklava Design. This is a metronome with two different theme options. It has a beat feature according to the rhythm. There is also a BPM setting. In  addition to them, there are three sound options in my project.
